Bank Churn Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for conducting churn analysis in the banking industry. The project aims to analyze customer churn patterns within a bank's customer base, identify factors influencing churn, and develop predictive models to forecast customer attrition.

Key Components:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Explore and preprocess the dataset containing historical customer data. Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into customer churn behavior. Visualize key trends, patterns, and correlations in the data to understand factors influencing churn.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features or predictors that are most indicative of customer churn. Use techniques like feature importance ranking, correlation analysis, and domain knowledge to select the most important features for modeling.

Model Development: Build predictive models to forecast customer churn. Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting machines. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation and Validation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using cross-validation techniques and validation datasets. Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing model for deployment.

Deployment: Deploy the selected model for real-time prediction of customer churn. Integrate the model into the bank's existing systems or deploy it as a standalone application for churn prediction.

Documentation: Provide detailed documentation including project overview, data sources, data preprocessing steps, model development process, model evaluation results, and deployment instructions.
